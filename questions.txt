1.  What’s stdint.h?
1.  stdint.h defines several integral types with predefined width (for example, uint8_t has a width of eigth bits).

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
2.  uint8_t etc. are used to declare variables with the exact amount of bits determined by the numeric value in them (8, 16, 32).

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
3.  A BYTE has 1 byte, a DWORD has 4 bytes, a LONG also has 4 bytes and a WORD has 2 bytes.

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify
file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be the letters "B" and "M", in order to identify the file type.

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
5.  bfSize is inside the file header (BITMAPFILEHEADER), which contains information about the size, type and layout of a bitmap; biSize is in the
info header (BITMAPINFOHEADER), which contains information about the dimensions and the color format of a bitmap.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
6.  If a bitmap`s biHeight is negative, it means the picture is upside down.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
7.  biBitCount specifies the bitmap`s color depth.

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
8.  fopen returns NULL if the accessed file or the specified path doesn`t exist, or if there are permission issues.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
9.  The third argument in fread defines the number of elements to be read; in this case, the function reads chunks of information (headers
or pixels) with sizes given by sizeof.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
10. One.

11. What does fseek do?
11. fseek moves the pointer inside a file.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
12. SEEK_CUR starts to move the pointer from the begginig of the given file.
